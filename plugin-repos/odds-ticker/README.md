## Background Service

The plugin uses background data fetching for efficient API calls:

- Requests timeout after 30 seconds (configurable)
- Up to 3 retries for failed requests
- Priority level 2 (medium priority)
- Updates every hour by default (configurable)

## Data Sources

Odds data is fetched from various sports data APIs and aggregated for display. The plugin integrates with the main LEDMatrix odds management system.

## Dependencies

This plugin requires the main LEDMatrix installation and uses the OddsManager for data access.

## Installation

The easiest way is the Plugin Store in the LEDMatrix web UI:

1. Open `http://your-pi-ip:5000`
2. Open the **Plugin Manager** tab
3. Find **Odds Ticker** in the **Plugin Store** section and click
   **Install**
4. Open the plugin's tab in the second nav row to configure leagues,
   favorite teams, and display preferences

Manual install: copy this directory into your LEDMatrix
`plugins_directory` (default `plugin-repos/`) and restart the display
service.

## Troubleshooting

- **No odds showing**: Check if leagues are enabled and odds data is available
- **Missing channel logos**: Ensure broadcast logo files exist in your assets/broadcast_logos/ directory
- **Slow scrolling**: Adjust scroll speed and delay settings
- **API errors**: Check your internet connection and data provider availability

## Advanced Features

- **Channel Logos**: Automatically displays broadcast network logos
- **Game Filtering**: Filter by favorite teams or specific criteria
- **Odds Types**: Supports spread, moneyline, and totals
- **Time Display**: Shows game start times and countdown
- **Continuous Loop**: Optionally loop the ticker continuously

## Performance Notes

- The plugin is designed to be lightweight and not impact display performance
- Background fetching ensures smooth scrolling without blocking
- Configurable update intervals balance freshness vs. API load

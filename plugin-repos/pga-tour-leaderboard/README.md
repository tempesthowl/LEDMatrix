## Requirements

- LEDMatrix project (running on Raspberry Pi)
- Python 3.7+
- Internet connection for ESPN API access

## Installation

### 1. Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi

```bash
# Navigate to a location outside the LEDMatrix project
cd ~
git clone <your-repo-url> ledmatrix-golf
```

### 2. Install the plugin in LEDMatrix

Option A: Using the web UI (recommended)
1. Open the LEDMatrix web interface at `http://your-pi:5000`
2. Navigate to the Plugins section
3. Click "Add Plugin Repository"
4. Enter the path: `/home/pi/ledmatrix-golf` (or wherever you cloned it)
5. Click "Load Plugin"

Option B: Manual installation
```bash
# Copy the plugin to the LEDMatrix plugins directory
cd /path/to/LEDMatrix
mkdir -p plugins/ledmatrix-golf
cp -r ~/ledmatrix-golf/* plugins/ledmatrix-golf/

# Or create a symbolic link
ln -s ~/ledmatrix-golf plugins/ledmatrix-golf
```

### 3. Install dependencies

The LEDMatrix system will automatically install dependencies from `requirements.txt` when loading the plugin.

If you need to install manually:
```bash
cd /path/to/LEDMatrix
pip3 install -r plugins/ledmatrix-golf/requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure the plugin

Edit your LEDMatrix configuration (via web UI or `config.yaml`):

```yaml
plugins:
  pga-tour-leaderboard:
    enabled: true
    display_duration: 15
    update_interval: 600  # 10 minutes
    max_players: 10
    fallback_players: 5  # Players to show from previous tournament
    tournament_date_range: 7  # Look ahead 7 days
    font_size: 6
    font_name: "4x6-font.ttf"
    text_color:
      r: 255
      g: 255
      b: 255
    highlight_color:
      r: 255
      g: 215
      b: 0
```

### 5. Restart LEDMatrix

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ledmatrix
```

## Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Enable or disable the plugin |
| `display_duration` | number | `15` | How long to display the leaderboard (seconds) |
| `update_interval` | number | `600` | How often to refresh data from ESPN (seconds, 60-3600) |
| `max_players` | integer | `10` | Maximum number of players to display (1-20) |
| `fallback_players` | integer | `5` | Number of players from previous tournament to show as fallback (1-20) |
| `tournament_date_range` | integer | `7` | Number of days to look ahead for tournaments (0-30) |
| `font_size` | integer | `6` | Font size for text (4-12) |
| `font_name` | string | `"4x6-font.ttf"` | Font file to use (from assets/fonts) |
| `text_color` | object | `{r:255,g:255,b:255}` | RGB color for text (white) |
| `highlight_color` | object | `{r:255,g:215,b:0}` | RGB color for highlighting top 3 (gold) |

### Font Options

Available fonts (from LEDMatrix assets/fonts):
- `4x6-font.ttf` - Small, compact font (recommended for 64x32 displays)
- `PressStart2P-Regular.ttf` - Retro pixel font
- `tom-thumb.ttf` - Tiny font for maximum information density

### Color Customization

Colors are specified as RGB values (0-255):

```yaml
# White text
text_color:
  r: 255
  g: 255
  b: 255

# Gold highlight for leaders
highlight_color:
  r: 255
  g: 215
  b: 0

# Other color examples:
# Red: {r: 255, g: 0, b: 0}
# Green: {r: 0, g: 255, b: 0}
# Blue: {r: 0, g: 0, b: 255}
# Yellow: {r: 255, g: 255, b: 0}
```

## How It Works

1. **Data Fetching**: The plugin fetches PGA Tour leaderboard data from ESPN's public API
2. **Tournament Filtering**: It automatically filters to show only tournaments within your configured date range (e.g., today + 7 days)
3. **Fallback Mode**: If no current tournament is found, the plugin automatically searches for the most recent completed tournament (looks back up to 30 days) and displays the top finishers
4. **Leaderboard Display**: Shows player position, name, and score scrolling horizontally right-to-left
   - PGA Tour logo appears at the beginning of the scroll
   - Tournament name followed by all players separated by " | "
   - When showing a previous tournament, displays "PREV:" before the tournament name
5. **Highlighting**: The tournament name and top 3 players are displayed in the highlight color (gold by default)
6. **Scrolling**: Smooth horizontal scrolling animation at 120 FPS for readability
7. **Caching**: API responses are cached to respect the update interval and minimize requests

## Display Format

The display is split into two sections:
- **Top section (24 pixels)**: PGA logo + player standings scroll horizontally right-to-left
- **Bottom section (8 pixels)**: Tournament name remains static (centered)

**Current Tournament Display:**
```
Top (scrolling):    [🏌️] 1. *J.Smith -5 (12) | 2. A.Jones -4 (F) | 3. *B.Lee -3 (15) | ... →
Bottom (static):              The Genesis Invitational
```

**Previous Tournament Fallback:**
```
Top (scrolling):    [🏌️] 1. J.Smith -12 (F) | 2. A.Jones -10 (F) | 3. B.Lee -8 (F) | ... →
Bottom (static):            PREV: The American Express
```

**Display Elements:**
- **Top section**: Scrolling content
  - **PGA Tour logo** leads the scroll (up to 36px wide, sized to fill scroll area)
  - **Asterisk (*)** prefix indicates player is currently on the course
  - **Holes completed** shown in parentheses: (12) = through 12 holes, (F) = finished round
  - **Top 3 players** highlighted in gold
  - **Remaining players** in white
  - **Smooth scrolling** animation at 120 FPS
  - **Separator** " | " between entries

- **Bottom section**: Static tournament bar
  - **Tournament name** centered and in gold/highlight color
  - **"PREV:"** prefix for previous tournaments
  - **Auto-truncated** if name is too long to fit display

**Examples:**
- `1. *S.Scheffler -8 (14)` - Scottie Scheffler in 1st place, 8 under par, currently playing hole 14
- `2. R.McIlroy -7 (F)` - Rory McIlroy in 2nd place, 7 under par, finished the round
- `3. *J.Thomas -6 (9)` - Justin Thomas in 3rd place, 6 under par, currently playing hole 9

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not showing up
- Check that the plugin is enabled in the configuration
- Verify the plugin is loaded: Check the LEDMatrix logs at `/var/log/ledmatrix/ledmatrix.log`
- Ensure the manifest.json is valid JSON

### No tournament data displayed
- Check that there's a PGA Tour event within your configured date range
- Verify internet connectivity: `ping site.api.espn.com`
- Check the update interval - data may be cached
- View logs for API errors

### Display issues
- Try a smaller font size if text is cut off
- Adjust `max_players` if not all players fit on screen
- Check display dimensions match your LED matrix size

### Viewing logs

```bash
# View LEDMatrix logs
tail -f /var/log/ledmatrix/ledmatrix.log | grep pga-tour

# Or via journalctl
sudo journalctl -u ledmatrix -f | grep pga-tour
```

## ESPN API Information

This plugin uses ESPN's public API endpoint:
```
https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/golf/pga/scoreboard
```

**Note**: This is an unofficial API. ESPN does not officially support or document this endpoint, and it may change without notice. For production use or guaranteed reliability, consider using an official golf API service like [SportsDataIO](https://sportsdata.io/) or [Sportradar](https://sportradar.com/).

**Update v1.1.1**: Changed from `/leaderboard` to `/scoreboard` endpoint as the leaderboard endpoint was returning 404 errors.

## PGA Tour Logo

The plugin displays the PGA Tour logo at the beginning of the scrolling leaderboard.

**Logo File Location:**
```
assets/sports/pga_logos/pga_logo.png
```

**Setup Instructions:**
1. Download or create a PGA Tour logo (PNG format, 20x28px recommended)
2. Create the directory on your Raspberry Pi:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /path/to/LEDMatrix/assets/sports/pga_logos
   ```
3. Upload the logo file:
   ```bash
   scp pga_logo.png pi@your-pi-ip:/path/to/LEDMatrix/assets/sports/pga_logos/
   ```
4. Set permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod 644 /path/to/LEDMatrix/assets/sports/pga_logos/pga_logo.png
   ```

**Note**: See [PGA_LOGO_README.md](PGA_LOGO_README.md) for detailed logo setup instructions, troubleshooting, and requirements.

If the logo file is not found, the plugin will log a warning and display the leaderboard without the logo.
